In SQL Server, table variable can be pushed out to tempdb.

In MSDN[1]

>A table variable is not necessarily memory resident. 
Under memory pressure, the pages belonging to a table variable can be pushed out to tempdb.

So, we should be careful when we use table variable in procedure.

There are lots of alternatives.

In MSDN[2]

A memory-optimized table variable:
* Is stored only in memory, and has no component on disk.
* Involves no IO activity.
* Involves no tempdb utilization or contention.
* Can be passed into a stored proc as a table-valued parameter (TVP).
* Must have at least one index, either hash or nonclustered.
** For a hash index, the bucket count should ideally be 1-2 times the number of expected unique index keys, but overestimating bucket count is usually fine (up to 10X). For details see Indexes for Memory-Optimized Tables.

A. Scenario: Replace global tempdb ##table

B. Scenario: Replace session tempdb #table

C. Scenario: Table variable can be MEMORY_OPTIMIZED=ON
```SQL
CREATE TYPE dbo.typeTableD  
    AS TABLE  
    (  
        Column1  INT   NOT NULL   INDEX ix1,  
        Column2  CHAR(10)  
    )  
    WITH  
        (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON);  
```
